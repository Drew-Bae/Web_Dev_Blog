          Welcome to my first blog post! My name is Drew Bae and I am an
          aspiring web developer. My goal is to keep you updated with the latest
          trends and techniques in web development through my comprehensive
          blog. I will be sharing relevant codes and links to aid you on your
          web development journey. I hope you will subscribe and join me on this
          exciting journey.
          <br /><br />
          The topic of this post is Artificial Intelligence (AI). It's 2023, and
          AI has captured everyone's attention, especially the well-known AI
          model, ChatGPT. Although I am not an expert in the field of AI, I can
          clearly see its significance. When I first heard about AI's
          capabilities, I was skeptical, but I decided to try it out for myself.
          I created an account to access ChatGPT and was astounded by its
          capabilities.
          <br /><br />
          At the time, I was working on a personal project and had been
          struggling with a problem for two days. I decided to ask ChatGPT for
          help, and to my surprise, the AI model solved the problem in just 15
          seconds. The question was, "How do I make a video a background using
          CSS?" The fact that an AI model could solve a problem that had taken
          me two days was both amazing and a little disheartening. I had just
          earned a B.S. degree in Computer Science that took me four years, and
          now I was wondering if AI was going to replace me.
          <br /><br />
          However, after some research and reflection, I realized that AI is not
          here to replace us, but to assist us. AI has the ability to process
          and analyze data at a much faster pace than humans, freeing us up to
          focus on higher-level tasks. In web development, AI can automate
          tedious tasks, improve user experience, and provide valuable insights
          and solutions.
          <br /><br />
          Take this blog as an example. It was designed entirely by AI! If you
          take a look at my post, you can find the design created by MidJourney
          at the bottom. I made some modifications for optimization purposes.
          Also, if you click the button, it will guide you on how to do the
          same.
          <br /><br />
          As a web developer, it's essential to stay informed about the latest
          advancements in AI and see how it can enhance our skills. Embracing
          change and utilizing AI to our advantage will make us stronger web
          developers.
          <br /><br />
          In conclusion, AI is here to support us, not replace us. As web
          developers, we should stay informed and embrace the changes that AI
          brings to our field. I hope this post has given you a glimpse into the
          world of AI and its relation to web development. If you have any
          questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments

          with you in my future blog posts!
